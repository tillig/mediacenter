D-Link DAP-1522
===============

I originally bought a `D-Link DAP-1522 <http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-Wireless-Gigabit-Extender-DAP-1522/dp/B001769K3O?tag=mhsvortex>`_ as a wireless bridge upstairs, before I got the :doc:`powerline adapters <powerline>`.

**As a wireless bridge, it's crap.** I really wanted to like it, but for some reason it never kept a connection to the wireless network. I can't tell you how many times I reset it to factory defaults or lost the ability to do any configuration on it at all.

**As an access point, it's great.** I've had no trouble using it as a second wireless access point to expand coverage in the house.

Wireless-N
----------
In order to get the DAP-1522 to do wireless N speeds (specifically when running it as an access point), you have to...

- Use the AES cipher with WPA or WPA2 (WPA2 is recommended).
- Set the channel width to 20/40 Auto.
- If there are still troubles getting N speeds, set it to 802.11N only or G/N mixed.

Connecting Manually to the Admin Page

If you have trouble connecting to the admin page at ``http://dlinkap`` then you may need to connect manually.

- Connect your computer to the access point with an Ethernet cable.
- Go into the adapter settings for the network adapter you've connected to the access point.
- Update the TCP/IPv4 settings on the adapter so it's not DHCP anymore. Use these settings:
    - IP = 192.168.0.99
    - Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.0
    - Gateway = 192.168.0.50
- Now open up a browser and go to 192.168.0.50 as you normally would to get to the configuration page. It should come up.

Resetting the Bridge
--------------------
Sometimes for whatever reason the DAP-1522 loses connection to the network and just hangs. Super annoying. This is why I eventually stopped using it as a bridge.

Here's how to totally reset it and get it working in bridge mode again.

#. Switch DAP-1522 to Auto mode. (In Bridge mode you can't access the admin console.)
#. Reset the DAP-1522 by pressing the reset button.
#. Follow the instructions above to connect manually to the admin page.
#. Log in using "admin" and no password.
#. Under Maintenance/System, reset the DAP-1522 to system defaults.
#. Under Maintenance/Admin, update the "admin" password.
#. Under Setup/Network Settings configure the access point for...

    #. LAN Connection Type = Static IP
    #. Access Point IP Address = 192.168.1.200 (Set up a static IP address in your router. I used .200 for mine; you can use a different IP address for yours.)
    #. Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.0
    #. Default Gateway = 192.168.1.1
    #. Device Name = dlinkap

#. After saving the settings, switch your network settings on the computer to...

    #. IP = 192.168.1.99
    #. Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.0
    #. Gateway = 192.168.1.200 (Use the static IP address of the access point from above.)

#. After switching settings, try to reconnect to http://192.168.1.200 (the static IP) and ensure you can still get to the dlinkap admin console.
#. At this point, the DAP-1522 should be flashing the orange light on the front indicating it's in bridge mode.
#. Run through the wireless setup wizard on the DAP-1522 to connect to the wireless network. For some reason, you can't just enter the data manually.
#. Switch the computer network settings to DHCP and see if you can get to the internet. You should be able to.
#. Connect to the DAP-1522 at http://192.168.1.200 (the static IP) again and log in. The admin password may have been reset to empty, so you may have to fix that again.
