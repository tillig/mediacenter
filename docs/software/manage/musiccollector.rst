Music Collector
===============

`Music Collector <http://www.collectorz.com/music/>`_ is the program I use to manage my audio collection - discs and digital files.

The Collectorz.com programs are all pretty good for collection management and I'm pretty happy with Music Collector. It even provides you with the ability to sync your collection online for easy access (`here's mine <http://cloud.collectorz.com/tillig/music/view>`_).

The only real thing I don't like about Music Collector is that the database of metadata is not terribly clean. You can generally find several copies of a given album coming from several different sources and almost all of them are incomplete or have errors. If metadata quality in your collection management software is important, this may not be for you... but I don't know what your other options are. I cope with this by keeping the high-quality metadata actually in the digital audio track files and/or in the :doc:`iTunes <itunes>` database rather than in Music Collector.
